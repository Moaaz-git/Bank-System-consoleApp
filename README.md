A simple, educational console-based bank system written in C++. The application demonstrates common banking operations (account creation, authentication, deposits/withdrawals, and transaction history) using console I/O and file-based persistence. It‚Äôs intended as a learning project and a base for further enhancements.

## Features ‚ú®

- üîí Secure-ish login with username/password (basic authentication for demo)
- üí≥ Create and manage bank accounts
- ‚ûï Deposit and ‚ûñ Withdraw funds
- üí∞ Check account balance
- üìú View transaction history
- üóÉÔ∏è Simple file-based persistence for accounts and transactions
- ‚úÖ Basic input validation and console menus

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

Requirements
- A C++ compiler supporting C++17 or later (g++, clang, MSVC)
- Optional: make or CMake for a more reproducible build

Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Moaaz-git/Bank-System-consoleApp.git
cd Bank-System-consoleApp
```

Build with g++ (simple)
```bash
# If source files are at the repo root
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -Wall -Wextra -o BankSystem *.cpp
```

Build with CMake (if you add a CMakeLists.txt)
```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

Run the app
```bash
# Unix / macOS
./BankSystem

# Windows
BankSystem.exe
```

If source files live under src/, adjust the compile command:
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -Wall -Wextra -o BankSystem src/*.cpp
```

## Usage ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

When you run the program, you'll see a menu-driven interface. Use numeric selections to navigate.

Example session:
```text

Notes
- Follow on-screen prompts to perform operations.
- Data is persisted to files in the working directory (example filenames may include accounts and transactions data files). Check the repo for exact filenames used by your local build.

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

- No environment variables required by default.
- Persistence: the app writes data files to the current working directory. Ensure the program has write permission.
- If you want to customize file paths or behavior, consider adding a configuration header (e.g., config.h) or a JSON/TOML config file and document keys here.

Suggested configuration variables (not implemented by default, add if you extend the app):
- DATA_DIR ‚Äî path to store data files
- AUTO_BACKUP ‚Äî enable/disable periodic backups of data files

## Contributing ü§ù

Thanks for considering contributing! Suggested workflow:

1. Fork the repository and create a branch for your change:
   - git checkout -b feature/my-improvement
2. Keep changes focused and add comments where logic is non-obvious.
3. Prefer modern C++ practices (C++17+).
4. If you add new behavior, include usage examples or a small script to exercise it.
5. Open a pull request with a clear description of the change and motivation.

Please open issues for bugs or feature requests. Include steps to reproduce and expected behavior.
